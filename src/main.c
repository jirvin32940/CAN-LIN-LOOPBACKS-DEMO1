 * CHASSIS AND BOARD STATISTICS STORED IN FLASH

 * Using the bottom-most flash inside the Atmel processor.
 * Processor flash is organized as 128 byte sectors, and rated for 100,000 erase cycles.
 *
 *	DATA										UPDATE FREQUENCY
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * -(0)Serial ID and flags						Serial IDs for each LED board logged when a board is plugged into the chassis.
 *												An entry is maintained for the board's top side, and another entry for the bottom side
 *												 *if* the board is not in an outer slot (0 or 4). A board in slot 0 will only have the
 *												 bottom side tracked, and a board in slot 4 will only have its top side tracked. (If the board
 *												 is later moved to another slot, the second side will also start being tracked at that point.)
 *												This structure has room for 96 entries: 12 complete sets of 8 LED board sides which should be 
 *												more than enough to cover the life of the product.
 *												This structure also tracks whether this slot in the structure has been filled, and whether
 *												max hour usage (2000 hours) has been reached.
 * -(1)Chassis sanitation cycles				Incremented on start of each sanitation cycle.
 * -(2)Usage hours								Each LED board side's sanitation usage hours are tracked in this structure. Like the Serial ID and flags
 *												 struct, it has 96 entries per buffer.
 * -(3)Usage in minutes + chassis san minutes	Similar structure to the usage hours structure, except here we only track usage minutes.
 *												The reason for breaking them out separately is because there are potentially 96 entries that need
 *												to be updated once per minute, and since there is no guarantee that the minutes will roll over to
 *												hours at the same time for each of the 96 entries, we need to create lots of buffers for this struct
 *												to make sure we don't exceed the flash max erase cycles of 100,000.
 * -(4)Configuration							User discretion. 2 copies at 100,000 erase cycles should be *more* than enough. Who is going to change 
 *												 initialDTE more than 200,000 times during the lifetime of the chassis? <famous last words.>
